# ffmpeg Download Engine

**LiveMe Tools now by defaults uses only FFMPEG to download the streams.**

You no longer are required to download and install it on your computer as it will now be 
downloaded and installed automatically if it has not been previously downloaded.

If you want to ensure no problems, you can manually download it and install it in 
a directory located in the path from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
