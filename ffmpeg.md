# ffmpeg Download Engine

When set to use the FFMPEG engine for downloading, LiveMe Tools will download playlists
and convert them from TS to MP4 format on the fly while downloading.  This will save
most people an additional step of performing video conversion.

## Downloading
Official downloads can be obtained from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Installing
### Windows
Extract the downloaded archive.  You should see 3 executable files in the bin folder.
Copy just the FFMPEG.EXE file to the directory where you have LiveMe Tools installed.

### Linux
#### Ubuntu/Debian/Mint
```sudo apt install ffmpeg -y```

#### RedHat/Fedora/CentOS
```sudo yum ffmpeg```

### macOS
