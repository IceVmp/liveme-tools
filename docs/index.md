Welcome to LiveMe Tools page.  

I started this project as just something to do to see if I could figure things out and make them better.  The results
of my work started growing in popularity and power.

Originally it was written relying on PHP/Apache code to do most of the data processing with HTML/Javascript Web App script for
interfacing.  

Starting with v2.x of the code, the interface was updated and I began porting the code to NodeJS/Electron to become a standalone 
solution for desktop computers.

When I began removing all dependency of the PHP server code, I started on v3.x of the code.  

Here on this GitHub page you will find the code and builds available.  I encourage you to try it out and to also help with
contributions so this can become an even more powerful tool for everyone to use.
