## Getting Started

### Downloading and Installing

**Thanks to Facebook a couple modules used by this project can now only be installed using `yarn` 
package manager.  The rest can still be installed using `npm`.**

**This uses the custom [LiveMe API](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-api) module also developed by our developers and contributors.**

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-tools/releases/latest)
if you wish to not compile it yourself.

Also you will need to manually install FFMPEG on your computer.  For Linux users, please get it from your distribution's repository.
For Windows and macOS users, please download a prebuilt binary from [here](http://ffmpeg.org) and install in a folder in your path.
