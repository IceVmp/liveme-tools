## Getting Started

### Downloading and Installing

[![All Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/thecoder75/liveme-tools/total.svg)](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-tools/releases)

*The 7.0.x releases seem to be buggy or problematic for some users and therefore its is recommended to download the [6.2.1 stable release](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-tools/releases/tag/6.2.1) for now.*

You can still download the [latest pre-release](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-tools/releases/latest) if you want to check out the latest features and more.

**This project now uses the `yarn` package manager instead of `npm`.**

**This uses the custom [LiveMe API](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-api) module also developed by our developers and contributors.**
